## 💡 Introduction

BlackMorror models betrayal before it happens. Through automated adversaries, simulated organizations, and high-fidelity attack chains, it exposes both human and system vulnerabilities.

## 🎯 Purpose

Designed for security teams, researchers, and executives, BlackMorror uncovers systemic weaknesses before real-world attackers exploit them. It merges human behavior insights, technical vulnerabilities, and strategic adversary simulations to guide informed security decisions.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Automated Adversary Workflows:** Realistic, autonomous decision-making to mimic real attackers.
- **Mock Environments:** Includes detailed company structures, employee personas, and web portals.
- **Full Attack Chain Simulation:** From initial phishing to privilege escalation and data exfiltration.
- **Advanced Visualizations:** Clearly showcases system exposure, attack paths, and potential failure points.
- **Team Training Scenarios:** Empowers teams to understand, identify, and respond to sophisticated threats in a controlled environment.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

A high-level overview of the core technologies powering BlackMorror:

- **Containerization:** `Docker`
- **Workflow Automation:** `n8n`
- **Scenario Storage:** `MongoDB` (Optional Backend)
- **Secure Communications:** `Nginx` with TLS

## 📈 Impact & Use Cases

- **Resilience Testing:** Test organizational resilience against advanced persistent threats (APTs) without operational risk.
- **Hyperrealistic Training:** Train security teams, incident responders, and systems using controlled, high-fidelity attack simulations.
- **Vulnerability Discovery:** Proactively identify and remediate both human and technical vulnerabilities before real-world exploitation.
